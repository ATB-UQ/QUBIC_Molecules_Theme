    </header>
    <main>
        <p>We will be holding monthly QUBIC Molecules Theme meetings on the first Thursday of the month. 
            These meetings will be an opportunity for students and EMCRs to gain experience presenting their work to a general audience as well as to discuss general business within the Molecules theme. <br>
            We will aim for 2 presentations per meeting that are <b>15 minutes in length with 5-10 minutes for questions</b> and discussion.</p>
        <p> For questions about the schedule or if you want to organise a talk, please contact Martin at <a href='mailto:m.stroet@uq.edu.au'>m.stroet@uq.edu.au</a></p>
